# AVL-TREE-PYTHON
AVL TREE (Balanced BST) is our 3rd semester's course (Data Structures and Algorithms) project.
#### This project contains class AVL Tree (Balanced BST) with its following methods:
##### 1.	INSERT:
Running time O(logn), inserts a node along with balancing a tree after every insertion.

##### 2.	DELETE:
Running time O(logn), deletes a node using 3 cases of BST along with balancing a tree after every deletion.

##### 3.	SEARCH:
Running time O(logn), searches a node in a tree.

##### 4.	LEFT ROTATION:
Rotates left if right side of a tree is unbalanced (heavy).

##### 5.	RIGHT ROTATION:
Rotates right if left side of a tree is unbalanced (heavy).

##### 6.	BALANCE FACTOR:
Contains a formula for checking the state of a node is balanced and fulfills the AVL properties or not.

##### 7.	HEIGHT:
Returns height of a tree.

##### 8.	SIZE:
Running time O(logn), returns size of a tree.

##### 9.	INORDER:
Running time O(n), returns in order tree traversal with increasing order (left, root, right).  

##### 10.	PREORDER:
Running time O(n), returns in order tree traversal with increasing order (root, left, right).

##### 11.	POSTORDER:
Running time O(n), returns in order tree traversal with increasing order (left, right, root).

##### 12.	SUCCESSOR:
Returns successor of a node in a tree. (max value in the right sub tree)

##### 13.	PREDECESSOR:
Returns predecessor of a node in a tree. (max value in the left sub tree)

##### 14.	MAXIMUM:
Returns maximum node of a tree.

##### 15.	MINIMUM:
Returns minimum node of a tree.
